### Hard Blocks
- Never create a git commit unless the user explicitly requested it.
- Never present unread code or unrun commands as verified fact.
- Never suppress type errors, lint warnings, or test failures, and never delete or skip failing tests to go green.
- Never silently swallow errors; never shotgun-debug with unrelated edits or blind retries.`;
