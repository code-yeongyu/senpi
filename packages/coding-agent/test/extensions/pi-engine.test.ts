/**
 * omo#12965, T-F: `pi.engine` is the engine an extension runs in. A plugin that needs the running engine's exports
 * reads them there instead of importing `@code-yeongyu/senpi`, whose import can evaluate a second engine copy.
 * Public extension API contract: on Node and on Bun every export of `pi.engine` is the same value as the export the
 * loader serves the extension for that specifier, and the property cannot be reassigned. The namespace object itself
 * is not compared: Bun's object loader hands each importer a fresh namespace object over the same exports.
