## 2026-10-07 - Lazy request setup preserves OAuth retry diagnostics (senpi#2893)

### What changed

- `packages/ai/src/api/lazy.ts`: attach the fixed OAuth-unavailable diagnostic with provider-only details when asynchronous authentication setup fails transiently.

### Why

The lazy stream converted the branded auth error into plain text, causing an immediate fallback instead of same-model recovery.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The lazy setup converter owns the assistant message before session retry hooks see it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `createSetupErrorMessage` in `lazy.ts`.
