## 2026-10-07 - Preserve transient OAuth exchange failures (senpi#2893)

### What changed

- `packages/ai/src/auth/oauth-refresh.ts`: preserve caller cancellation; log one JSON-encoded provider/optional-slot/closed-cause line per transient exchange without changing stored credentials. JSON encoding prevents object inspection or embedded newlines from splitting the log record.
- `packages/ai/src/auth/resolve.ts`: map transient exchanges to a symbol-branded OAuth ModelsError while preserving permanent errors and message text.

### Why

Transport failures during refresh lost their retryability and ended unattended turns.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Exchange classification and credential resolution happen before provider requests or extension recovery hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The exchange catch in `oauth-refresh.ts` and error mapping in `resolve.ts`.
